I am an MPhil student in Artificial Intelligence at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GuangZhou), advised by Prof. [Hui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Xuming Hu](https://xuminghu.github.io/). My research focuses on building efficient, robust, and trustworthy Multimodal AI systems, particularly for video understanding and reasoning.

I am currently exploring how to build more general agentic frameworks that can reason and reflect. In addition, I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2026.
